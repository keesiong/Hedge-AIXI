  abstract =     "This book presents sequential decision theory from a
                  novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former
                  theory is suited for active agents in known environments, the
                  latter is suited for passive prediction of unknown environments.
                  The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas
                  and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free
                  theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent interacting with
                  an arbitrary unknown world. Most if not all AI problems can easily
                  be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual
                  problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes
                  include sequence prediction, strategic games, function
                  minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. Formal
                  definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem
                  and relations to other approaches to AI are discussed. One
                  intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about
                  abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely
                  to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.",

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives.",

The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously. If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the case of ``specialist'' experts. In this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating Algorithm.",

It is known that, under weak regularity, the learner can ensure that his cumulative loss never exceedscL+alnn, wherecandaare some constants,nis the size of the pool, andLis the cumulative loss incurred by the best expert in the pool.
